# Running the App

The recommended way to run this app is with [docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#prerequisites). 
More information on docker can be found [here](https://www.docker.com/what-docker).

### Setup docker configuration for production

First clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-eats/OpenEats.git
cd OpenEats
```

Then, create two files from the sample files:
- docker-prod.override.yml
- env_prod.list

```bash
cp docs/samples/sample_docker_prod_override.yml docker-prod.override.yml
cp docs/samples/sample_env_file.list env_prod.list
```

The `docker-prod.override.yml` specifies the port that OpenEats is served from as well as any additional configuration that overrides the defaults. 
It also allows the containers to reboot themselves when your machine restarts or if the containers fail. You can change this to `never` if you want to manually control when the containers start and stop.
By default the nginx docker container will serve as a reverse proxy for the other services, and serve its content on port 8000 on the host machine (forwarded from port 80 on the container).

#### Configure the environment file
Most of the settings in your `env_prod.list` can stay the same as `env_stg.list` that is in this repo. There are a few config settings that need to be changed for most configurations. 
See [Setting_up_env_file.md](Setting_up_env_file.md) for a complete description of the environment variables.

- [DATABASE_PASSWORD](Setting_up_env_file.md#MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD)
- [DJANGO_SECRET_KEY](Setting_up_env_file.md#DJANGO_SECRET_KEY)
- [ALLOWED_HOST](Setting_up_env_file.md#ALLOWED_HOST)
- [NODE_API_URL](Setting_up_env_file.md#NODE_API_URL)


##### Note on the ALLOWED_HOST option
The ALLOWED_HOST option must be set equal to the domain or IP address that users will access the site from.
For example, if you are hosting on "mydomain.com", enter:
``ALLOWED_HOST=mydomain.com``

If you are hosting on `192.168.0.12`, enter:
``ALLOWED_HOST=192.168.0.12``

Note that it is not necessary to specify the port.

##### Note on the NODE_API_URL option
 
The NODE_API_URL specifies the URL that services use to contact the API.
If you are running OpenEats on a port other than 80 or 443, it is necessary to specify this port in the NODE_API_URL option.
E.g. Given that the IP address for the OpenEats server is `192.168.0.12` and port is `1234`.

``NODE_API_URL=http://192.168.0.1:1234``

##### Note For LAN/Internet or static IP hosting 
If you are going to be hosting OpenEats from LAN/intranet or a static IP then you should double check two things within your environment file. 

Given that the IP address for the OpenEats server is `192.168.0.1` and port is `1234`.
1. Confirm that `ALLOWED_HOST=192.168.0.1`
2. Confirm that `NODE_API_URL=http://192.168.0.1:1234`

#### Connecting to a remote DB
If you are connecting the API to a remote DB (any non-dockerized DB) you need to setup the following configs to your env file.

- [MYSQL_DATABASE](Setting_up_env_file.md#MYSQL_DATABASE)
- [MYSQL_USER](Setting_up_env_file.md#MYSQL_USER)
- [MYSQL_HOST](Setting_up_env_file.md#MYSQL_HOST)
- [MYSQL_PORT](Setting_up_env_file.md#MYSQL_PORT)

You will also need to edit your `docker-prod.yml` file to remove the database from the setup process. See [this docker yml](samples/sample_docker_prod_remote_db.yml) for an example.

### Start docker containers

Once the files have been created run the command below and replace the version with version of OpenEats you want to run. You can also leave this blank (this will pull the latest code)

```bash
./quick-start.py -t 1.0.3
```
OR
```bash
./quick-start.py
```
OR
```bash
./quick-start.py --help
```

The quick start script will do a few things.
1. Creates a `docker-prod.version.yml` file with the required image tags.
2. Downloads the required images.
3. Takes a backup of the database and your images.
4. Restarts the OpenEats servers.

### First Time Setup

To create a super user:
``` bash
docker-compose -f docker-prod.yml run --rm --entrypoint 'python manage.py createsuperuser' api
```
Follow the prompts given to create your user. You can do this as many times as you like.

If you want to add some test data you can load a few recipes and some news data. This data isn't really needed unless you just wanna see how the app looks and if its working.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-prod.yml run --rm --entrypoint 'sh' api
./manage.py loaddata course_data.json
./manage.py loaddata cuisine_data.json
./manage.py loaddata news_data.json
./manage.py loaddata recipe_data.json
./manage.py loaddata ing_data.json
```

### Setting up a Proxy Server and HTTPS
The nginx reverse proxy will default to run on port 8000. You will most likely want to change the port that nginx runs on. 
See [Creating a proxy server for docker](Creating_a_proxy_server_for_docker.md) for more information on how to configure an nginx server to serve OpenEats.
